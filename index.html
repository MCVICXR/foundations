		    <p>When the door to the room swung open, the squeaky hinge made the girl look up from her work. The young man, whom she had never seen before, that stood in the doorway wore a quizzical look on his face, his gaze directed at her. She immediately looked back down at her work, but she couldn't seem to remember where she was. She stared at her parchment, her hand frozen in place above the surface. Ink dripping from her unmoving quill started to pool. As she tried to appear focused, she heard approaching footsteps. The boy suddenly sat down in the chair that was unoccupied to her right. She looked up. He was looking back at her. She felt her cheeks start to tingle.</p>
		    <p>"Hi," he simply said, a subtle yet smug smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.His accent strange accent caught her off guard, but it suddenly all made sense. She cleared her throat, sat up straight, and gained her composure.</p>
		    <p>"You're that new transfer student," she said tried to sound dismissive, "The American that  was sorted into Ravenclaw."</p>
		    <p>"Yeah," the boy said softly, "I dunno what the big deal is though. We don't even have houses back at my old school. And from what I hear I probably woulda been a Gryffindor a few years ago, but, you know, people change."</p>
				<p>The end of his response came with a flashed grin. Her heartbeat quickened.Before she knew it, she said, "Well, I'm in Slytherin," and immediately regretted it for some strange reason. The boy nodded his head and said, "Cool."</p>
				<p>Her eyes fell on his blonde curls and didn't move. She was caught off guard when he stuck out his right hand to her and said, "Well, I'm Rob McVicar, captain of the quidditch team. What's your name?"</p>
